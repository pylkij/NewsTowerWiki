A trait - also called a personality in the game code - is a suplementary ability which can serve to aid or harm an employee's ability to preform their job. Traits can be natural (set at [[hiring]]) or learned through the [[training]] menu. Learned traits may be changed at any time at the cost of removing any current learned trait. Natural traits can not be changed and will result in higher wages comprared to a traitless employee of the same [[skill]] level.
