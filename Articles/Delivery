==Overview==
[[Item]]s can be delivered to [[station]]s by [[employee]]s. [[Hauler]]s have bonuses to delivery, and are the only employees who can move [[box]]es.

==Factors==
Employees of a [[production]] station will choose to deliver their stations output [[production item]]s under certain conditions. Normally, they will never deliver items to a subsequent production station that is not on their [[floor]]. However, they will use [[pneumatic tube]]s to send items to the correct floor for further processing.

[[Reporter]]s will deliver [[report]]s to [[editor desk]]s, [[typesetting desk]]s, and [[typesetting machine]]s. They will prioritize pneumatic tubes if they are faster than [[stair]]s or [[elevator]]s. [[Photographer]]s will deliver [[film]] to [[darkroom]]s. [[Cartographer]]s and [[illustrator]]s will not deliver [[draft graphics]] to [[photo process desk]]s and [[photo editor]]s unless they are on the same floor.

[[Hauler]]s can be assigned to move [[items]] of all types. They will deliver items to other floors, as long as their [[floor asignment]] allows for it.

==Tips and strategies==
{{Subjective}}
Early game, the typical approach is to keep a whole production chain on one floor. However, once pneumatic tubes are [[unlock]]ed, layout options expand dramatically. Still, dedicated haulers on production floors will increase production efficiency by making sure that employees never have to leave their station to get inputs or deliver outputs, even after pneumatic tubes are unlocked. It is recommended that any designated hauler is assigned to no tasks other than hauling production documents on the desired floor(s) as other assignements will result in delays when a hauler on the other side of the tower will be assigned to a production item delivery task, and no one will take over that task, even if it would be faster.
