==Overview==
The typesetting machine is a [[production]] station which takes [[report]]s and [[draft ad]s, and converts them into [[text slug]]s. It employes a production employee with the [[typesetting]] skill. It has a base production time of 12 hours. It can be further enhanced by typesetting [[accessories]].

The typesetting machine represents a 50% production speed increase over the [[typesetting desk]] at the cost of reducing [[comfort]],  lower [[durability]], and high [[trash]] production.

==Availability==
The typesetting machine is available at the [[Caldwell Linotype Factory]], located in [[Queens]]. It costs 24 [[Influence Point]]s to unlock, and has no purchase pre-requisits once the location has been unlocked.

==Tips and strategies==
{{subjective}}
The typesetting machine is faster and has a smaller footprint compared to the [[typesetting desk]], which makes fitting it into crowded production floors easier. Because of its relatively low impact on [[comfort]], it pairs well with the political and brick [[wallpaper]]. However, the lower [[durability]] and higher [[trash]] production do have to be accounted for. The lack of space for a [[trashcan]] underneath the machine does negate some of the reduced footprint. The typesetting machine pairs well with the [[big trashcan]], but this has an even larger footprint. The [[messy]] trait is sometimes recommended for [[typesetter]]s, but you will then require a dedicated [[sweeper]] to handle the mess when you upgrade to the typesetting machine.
