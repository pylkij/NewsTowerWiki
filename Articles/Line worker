==Description==
Line worker is a silver [[trait]] which can be trained. It can be found as a reward at the end of the month, at [[Saint Elizabeth College]] in [[Queens]], or at [[St. Paul's School]] in [[Brooklyn]]. If purchased, it will cost $5000. It can be [[training|trained]] to any [[production]] employee except [[lawyer]]s in 5 days.

==Availability==
{{Needs work|Accuracy}}
Line worker is available after 1932.

==Tips and strategies==
{{Subjective}}
Line worker is the best production trait any employee can be trained with, allowing for incredibly minimal production setups requiring only one employee of each production [[skill]]. It is especially potent when combined with the [[messy]], [[smelly]], and [[noisy]] natural [[trait]]s.
