==Overview==
Scoops are story [[tag]]s which will enable you to "steal" a [[district]] from a [[competitor]] newspaper. They are supplemental to the underlying tag type. In order to complete and therefore steal a district, all required scoops must be printed. This does not have to happen in a single [[issue]].

==Factors==
Scoops show up throughout the [[week]] and are required to complete the [[district]] objective. The game is heavily weighted to ensure that all required scoops are seen once through the week.

Some [[agenda]]s will require that a certain number of scoops are printed in an [[issue]].

Stories with scoops can contain the spy [[risk]].

==Tips and strategies==
{{Subjective}}
While there is weighting to ensure that all possible scoops are seen once per week, it is still recommended to prioratize [[lead]]s with [[tag]]s which are most likely to result in the desired tag type being found early.
