==Overview==
Leads are how many [[story|stories]] there are for your [[telegrapher]]s to research in a [[week]].

==Factors==
The factors which determine how many leads will show up in a given [[week]] are:
*How much historical content was made for that specific week
*The save file's progression
*Which [[district]] and/or [[agenda]] quest has been selected
*How many [[telegrapher]]s are unlocked
**[[European telegrapher]]s also play a role in this calculation

24 leads is the median once progression reaches a certain point and what the system likes to work towards.

==Tips and strategies==
{{Subjective}}
This is where subjective - but still neutral - analysis of the item can go. Maybe suggest a way in which the item is best used or placed.
