==Overview==
The Linotype machine is a [[production]] station which takes [[report]]s and [[draft ad]s, and converts them into [[text slug]]s. It employes a production employee with the [[typesetting]] skill. It has a base production time of 12 hours. It can be further enhanced by typesetting [[accessories]].

The Linotype machine represents a 50% production speed increase over the [[typesetting desk]] at the cost of reducing [[comfort]], and lower [[durability]].

==Availability==
The Linotype machine is available at the [[Caldwell Linotype Factory]], located in [[Queens]]. It costs 24 [[Influence Point]]s to unlock, and has no purchase pre-requisits once the location has been unlocked.

==Tips and strategies==
The Linotype machine is faster and has a smaller footprint compared to the [[typesetting desk]], which makes fitting it into crowded production floors easier. Because of its relatively low impact on [[comfort]], it pairs well with the political and brick [[wallpaper]].
