Redirected from "CoC"

==Conduct==
The News Tower Wiki Code of Conduct (CoC). All users, editors, and administrators are expected to abide by the CoC. Failure to do so will result in a warning. Failure to adhere to a warning may result in a temporary suspension or permanent ban.

===Civility===
Rudeness or insensitivity, whether intentional or not, can distract from and interfere with the function of the wiki. [[Dispute resolution]] is available when civil, reasoned discussion breaks down.

===Clean start===
Any user who is not subject to sanctions may abandon their account and start fresh under a new one, as long as the new account is not used in an improper manner.

===Consensus===
Consensus among equals is our only tool for resolving content disputes, and our primary tool for resolving all other disputes.

===Content===
This is a wiki for the video game News Tower. Any material not related to the intended topic is not permitted.

===Dispute resolution===
The first step to resolving any dispute is to talk to those who disagree with you. If that fails, there are more structured forms of discussion available.

===Edit warring===
If someone challenges your edits, discuss it with them and seek a compromise, or seek [[dispute resolution]]. Do not start fights over competing views and versions.

===Editing policy===
Improve pages where you can. Do not worry about imperfection. Explain all major changes.

===Harassment===
Do not make threats, nitpick good-faith edits, make reapeated annoying and unwanted contacts, personal attacks, or post any personal information (doxing).

===No personal attacks===
Do not make personal attacks anywhere. Comment on the content, not on the editor.

===Ownership of content===
Pages that you create and edit belong to the community. Others can and often will edit "your" material.

===Sockpuppetry===
Do not use multiple accounts to create the illusion of greater support for an issue, to mislead others, or to evade a block. Do not ask friends to create accounts to support you or anyone else.

===Usernames===
Choose a neutral username with which you will be happy. Inappropriate usernames will result in a request to change. Usernames should be similar to the discord username, or contain clear links to the discord user, that the individual uses on the News Tower Discord.

===Vandalism===
Vandalism is any addition, deletion, or change of content made in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of the wiki.

==Enforcement==
Everyone is human, nobody is perfect. However, sometimes actions must be taken against individuals who do not abide by the CoC

===Warnings===
Warnings will be given to any first time breach of the CoC, and in issues of minor infringement. Warnings are not threats, do not reflect upon the warned individual as a person, nor should result in any embarassment. Warnings are meant as a correction, and a reminder to everyone that this is a collaborative effort.

===Suspensions===
Disruptive editors and repeat offenders may be suspended from the wiki. Please respect these suspensions, do not attempt to evade suspensions, and do not bait users who have been suspended on the wiki, discord, or through any other means. A suspension will always be explained by the issuing administrator. These suspensions can last up to a month, at the discretion of the issuing administrator.

===Banning===
Extremely disruptive editors and serial offenders may be banned from the Wiki. Do not attempt to evade bans. Like suspensions, a ban will always be explained by the issuing administrator. A ban may be appealed to the community, depending on the nature of the ban. Bans which are made because of a breach of legal policies will not be appealed.

==Legal==
These are issues with potential legal implcations. Outside of these policies, the wiki will not practice censorship.

===Child protection===
Editors who advocate or attempt to pursue or facilitate inappropriate adult-child relationships are to be banned.

===Copyright violations===
Material copied from sources that are neither public domain nor compatibly licensed without permission from the copyright holder will be removed.

===Libel===
Libelous revisions will be deleted from the page history.

===Threats===
Threats, of any nature, will be reported promptly. Please use the [[dispute resolution]] process.

===Free use===
The cases in which you can declare a non-free image, audio clip, or video clip as "fair use" are rare. You must specify the exact use, and only use the material in that one context. Non-free content should only be used as a last resort.
